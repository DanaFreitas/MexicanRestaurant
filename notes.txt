sass --watch .

importing the navbar takes about half an hour...remember the @import

Have header     
        nav nav

2/11

I need to reorganize the arhcitecture of the styles for article (and give a real name)

I did learn about cover for background iamge

have seperate container for the background image

Try to modify the font weights. the eights for the buttons are too much.



2/12

relative: where "should" be then moved
asbolute: compared to parent

need to fix the headers. its being fixed

seperate the header itseelf from the animating of the transition

2/13

shrink font size of title

the bottom went too to the bottom. need to make responsive, but correctly

issue: with the bottom section, because of the margin bottom, 
it technically doesnt have a height. that is why the button is in a strange position. 

button was part of wrong parent

mixin isnt working

2/14

mixin works now, not sure what mistake was

used height to make sure all of the sections have a good height

work on the specific mixin more. figure out the children. chatgpt/previouswork

2/15

still work on opacity

moved the buttons outside the background...not a good idea fo rhte opening?


the children inheret the styles of the parent

Need to add the footer. also add boxes for the secitons of text

2/16

align vertical justify horizontal. longer so hori

used letter spacing for the ?s

perfect bem.

should I move up the buttons and seperate the sections better?

2/17

still need to figure out that centering
        maybe a grandparent

need to reorganize the css.
        have more stuff be in the "homesection" css
                contactus and whoweare

2/18

display:
inline horizontal limited
inlin-block horizontal but can stretch
block vertical

2/19

menu.scss AND typography scss were both involgin  the same text! eed to clean that up and organize better,

section tag was a problem

fill textts

2/20

ctrl-shift-e
get to the side stuff

did shading for images

for the texts, make sure to properly set the displays for the wrappers

did it. itle needed a z-index of 2 to work. idk why

ctrl d highlight copies of the code

used word break and width to make shorter

why is the first section of menu centered but not the others?

make the directions look better


2/21

the css for careers isnt working
nvm, misspelling

name in forms is used for browser requests

work on form
        should I use a placeholder?

include form to accept resume
include menu to accept jobs
include way to show what phone number to put include
        what to do about hyphens
remember FORM OVER FUNCTION

name of section on hop of input FOR NOW in mobile
        change for pc

look up clickable dropdown menu


there was an old liveform
        didnt update the form   
                did the trio
        now works

homepage

removed h1
        refreshed browser.
                nothing
        deleted and made new tab. worked.

went to careers
        old error still there 
                works now
        added new line
                doesnt work
accidentally tried again while on css
        went back to old page ctrl c
                didnt work
        right page now  ctrl c
                didnt work
undoing all bits
        command,watch,live
                didnt work
        watch,command,live
                didnt work

maybe the problem is that im using both the command line AND the extension

didnt work with just extension. maybe i need to wipe all of the liveservers first
        no. will try canceling the port too

...thats because the other one was being selected by default.

still...it might be worth to inquire if running both lives at once could be a problem

2/22

 <option value="none" selected disabled hidden>Select an Option</option>   

for forms, each part needs the same name

need better formatting
        the labels and inputs are much farther apart than the radio buttons and their labels      
                but i cant put those too far apart
        try having the section descriptions have the inputs
                can align everything to the left

come up with a backup font for rye        

rework the form buttons

2/23

fangsong

for font family "serif" or "san-serif" or generic stuff is a generic default


pages with buttons
        main
        NOT menu       
        NOT catering
        NOT directions
        careers
        contact
BUT.......the menu is on ALL pages

divide areas with sections or divs?



need to fix the buttons on the bottom...sooo close to finishing this part

replaced divs with sections

need to reorganize the forms
have the texts above the fields
        side by side doesnt work well on mobile

Had changed text colors from black to white because of dark backgrounds. need to find a good hover color. 
        remember: for testing, hover isnt a thing on mobile

to have the text in the right postion on the homepage, I need to use absolute display on the p tag.
        however...I need to find the right background for them, and/or darken the background images and make the text white.
                maybe have two different tests and compare side by side?

2/24 git reset is a thing

moved the labels up for the forms.

best practice find way to declare and set href locations using arrays

2/25

window.location vs location.href


need let thehref=pagename[i].getAttribute("href");
is it best practice to have the list of links in arrays together

does using notes.txt mess with the livesass



do something about the menu

issues: get rid of the slideout menu. it doesnt work as well when the transitions are with different sites

contact.html button isnt working. 

careers text needs a margin help
        a bunch do

location.html isnt working
        the hamburger button

the header needs a "top 0" if fixed to not move with the title being margin-topped

the button doesnt work for contact. idea: make a clone of it and see if the first version works. like issue with a loop.

2/27

just rided of slideout

issues left:

contact.html button not working...thats it really

clamp()

        .banner {
          width: clamp(200px, 50% + 20px, 800px); /* Yes, you can do math inside clamp()! */
        }

        1rem   = 360px and below
        Scaled = 361px - 839px
        3.5rem = 840px and above

did lots of notes on clamp(), min() or max()


elements and their widths



min .form {
    width: min(600px, 90vw);
}

the form will be whichever is smaller
        so if 670px, or niewm the smallest will be 600px as a max

the issue with the burgerholder responsive is that its a container and not visible
        do for the hamburger bits. the visible stuff, not the backgrounds
                use clamp

                 width:min(20vw,768px)
                              10vw ,15vw,768px 
                                maybe something like this?


for the call to action button, I need to make the tetxt as responsive as the button itself
        used 4vw

need to figure out the "about us" part.         
         a random image with the text wrapped ot next to it seems...tacjy.
        investigate what other sites do. 
                also the text

2/28

it goes from "powershell" to "node" because sass is likely a node.js script

maybe issue for me is too many powershells

issue: the buttons dont stick out enough. they just look like section headers

have smaller, white buttnos with a background of....
        maybe darken the backgrounds and have the buttons bottom middle?

OR...I could just go and remove the background colors around the subsection titles

maybe i meet in the middle     
        darken the background, have the titles be white and the buttons colorfful in the middle

This...entire time, the "backgrounds" mixin hasnt been working. I ahould either try try to fix it, or move stuff around
        are there other sections besides home that could use darkened background images?
...wrong about being wrong. the mixin IS working, its just applied to the menu and catering, not the backgrounds of the home page.
        likely need to do that and mess with the buttons there          
        alternate between red and green?
                have text too?

2/29

adjust the shadow amounts
make sure the texts are above the shading

3/1

the first background image is too long.

also a problem with the menu description.

maybe have only SOME images be darkened
        dark if description     
        light if not description

might be able to get rid of the titles...
        but first I need to center those images

I took the images, gave them some padding (width 80%) and a box shadow. it feels soooo much more...alive

make sure the "who we are" section isnt in a box
fix that tiny bit of difference between images and the box
        maybe do with other pages too?

3/2
tried to fix the image, couldnt do

made the text vw

make the headerwrapper for the nav display:none when ipad size
have the sections be side to side by ipad size

foe the burger have a max width

for the responsive title, should i have a second copy of it, or try to move it?

fix the grid for the sections

3/4

cant have the homesection AND the grid wrapper both be active at once

the text based sections are having scaling problems

cant use p for contain, only div

space between, no size at end
space around, half size at end
space evenly, whole size at end


have the responsivemenu buttons work too
have a max size for the hamburger button

should i treat the menus the same way as the sections?
        probably.


3/5

adding the grids has been fine so far.
need to 
        make a mixin for all of the section box styles
        have a max...or a min for the width of the sections             
                be 100% when movile, 80% when pc
                        clamp

some of the menus are wonky on top in pc mode  
        has something to do with 
                .header__defaultmenu--item being the default on the messed up one
        fixed. bad tags

todo

make footer look better responsive
        100% width
make the iframe responsve
        clamp the width...and the hight. aspect ratio
                default 100%, unless the width is x, thnen certain percentage
                        ...then max it

3/6
need to make menu buttons work
        check 
        fused two arrays and ran them together
and gridize the homepage
        check



make the iframe responsive
        check, used min 
fix widths
make footer look better responsive
        have the texts side to side after certain point

for careers and contact us. have a max width to the elements
        also make the buttons nicer

3/7

max width does
        for the buttons, should they be horizontal or vertical when on pc       
        still need to make nicer

need to fix the careers, not the contact us


GET RESETING problem
        had made change on html career page
                didnt save
        made change on css     
                did save all
        did live site shortcut
                html didnt change
        needed to refresh


got rid of the reset button

what i should do now if try to fix all of the widths and the alignments
        why does the pc header have that useless chunk to the right
                the header doesnt need 100% of the width. its width100% causing that
                the flexbox is based on that state before the 100% stretch, not after


3/10

need ot make the contact page taller?
for the menu, try looking at the mozart menu to make full width
width 100% helps with the gap, but I need to even out the items

fixed tge bottom
check if any issues iwth the menu animatiob
fugyre iyt the columns

animations fine

BIG problem with the menus      
        the title font size is static
        the nenu item font sizes are not

COULD solve by making the width 100%...maybe

3/11

general
        center the footer
                check
home    
        make the contact us bigger
                check
careers 
        more margins between the elements
                check
directions      
        need to center the text
                check

gave texts without a parent their own class.
grouping them with texts with parents caused farmatting issues due to double counting of widths


more issues
        the formatting of the menu items isnt aligned with thet titles for the menu and catering        
        in the pc version, there isnt any padding between the horizontally aligned images
        i should make the colors variables declared in mixins considering how universally used they are
                fixed

tomorrow, go for the menu formatting issues
        make max line width?
                then what about the size of the backgrounds?
also the horizontal padding issue       
        make responsive, > 976px


column and row gap

3/12

need to fix hero image size. too big on pc

transform scale. nee to fix the padding


3/13

make the question section bigger on homepage

Realized problem. The image is portrait. I need landascape. I thought I needed portrait because mobile. but on further inspection, other
hero images are landscapes that have either most of the image hidden, or resized

the box shadow causes the strange background-color-appear-effect
the shadow is around the container rather than the element itself      
        ex, covering th unused section of a flexbox or a grid
        SOLUTION: used margin instead of padding


3/14

Fixed some minor issues. I should be ready to go by the end of the weekend. make sure to check legal stuff.

3/15

For the menus and the catering,should the titles should be part of the list?


3/24

I thought I was done with this project. I thought I was done with it so much. But all of the tests I have been doing have been in vein. When I looked at the results...
they were all zoomed in. It turns out the text from the mnu doesnt scale the wat it should when the screen width changes.  

the heart of mexico title does. use that for comparison
        problem! the menu uses vw. the title uses rem. rem more stable.
                why?

other problems
        the footer for careers is the only one with a proper width
        the catering items dont have a proper size compared to the filter
        the widths of the titles need to be 100 too.

should make sure the widths SHOULD be 100%     
        Yes

for the section titles, make them 100%
        and make the title sizes responsive
for the footer, starting around width:900px, the words are too close together
        
3/25

for the proper pages, the margin-top messes everything up, dragging the page down.
for the bad pages, the margin-top fices everything. is it basd on the positioning of the siblings?
        ie being absolute or not?

remove some elements from catering to see is its a minimum hieght issue
My suspicion was corredt. The issue is related to the hieght of the page. 
I either need to detether the footer from the height OR make the height taller

The laptop dimensions are fine. The vertical ipad is the problem. That is why I didnt notice before. 
Solution: add more      
        a description?
        another image?
        both?

sent myself an image OutdoorPartyAdjusted 
Need a description of making sure to send ahead of time. add something positive sounding it not contrast too much with the imagery


3/26

I need to adjust the sizing of the img so that it overrides the default

3/27

I need to work with the sizing for the shadows, which is covering the entire page

have a call to action for the opening
change "contact" to "contact us" in the menu


width: min(100%, 48rem);
is about 769 px
baically: which is smaller, 100% width or 48rem?

3/28

for the footer, I have been using left, bottom and absolute position to keep the footer from sticking up
issue is that it effects the text responsiveness

Still having trouble with the footers. differentiate between the really short pages and the longer ones

3/29

The catering footer is messed up at certain levels

the shading is messed up too. the issue is that the ratios of the images alter when responsive

4/21

I have returned after working on the standalone base menu. I should be able to comfterably integrate it here. 
        need to save this version

                did weeks ago
        have comparisonsss of old and new code next to each other
               use code compaison tools to make it easier to replaced
        check if older issues were solved or not 


4/22

      <ul id="slidemenu" class="menu_slide" data-menu="default">

        containmenu
                        items

the difference is in the css and js
        css is good

Need to have containmenu be there onload
        mobile version is there onload, but the formatting is warped. for some reason, its column instead of row

notable difference. the standalone menu doesnt have a nav while the mexican project does

need to redirect how the hrefs work


original event

each button


() => {
  let thehref = fusedMenuArray[i].getAttribute("href");
  let hrefslice = thehref.slice(1);
  window.location.href = `${hrefslice}.html`;
  contain = []
}

(event) => {
  event.preventDefault();

  let topRelativeToDocument = getElementPositionRelativeToDocument(
    section[k]
  );

  let offsetPosition = topRelativeToDocument - heropadding; //- headerOffset;
  console.log(
    `offsetposition ${offsetPosition}  is ${heropadding} minus ${topRelativeToDocument}`

  window.scrollTo({

headerwrapper


() => {
  let thehref = fusedMenuArray[i].getAttribute("href");
  let hrefslice = thehref.slice(1);
  window.location.href = `${hrefslice}.html`;
  contain = []
}



in some capacity, the buttons triggered will work...but ther styles are all malaignefd
        Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "getAttribute", fusedMenuArray[k] is undefined
                happens after every time the men is clicked a second time
                issue is for the respon, theres an array in the array

general issues fro tomorrow:
        the trdpon buttons only click on another section of the page, not a different page
        the other pages need to be worked on 
        there is strange styling for the menu  
        meed to work one the default and responsive versions of the functions. 
                need to integrate both the menu and the older code to something new
remember: github is your friend.

1:51:42

4/23

fusedMenuArray only has 1 thing.
        Array [ div#headerwrapper.header__default--wrapper ]
        there should be a bunch of things in the array. no need for seperate default and responsive. so can have a bunch of things

        how menu worked


let ContainMenu = document.querySelector('[data-menustate="default"]');
let ContainMenuId = document.getElementById("ContainMenu");
let ContainMenuChildren = ContainMenu.children;
let MenuButton = document.querySelectorAll('[data-button="defaultmenuitem"]');


    ContainMenuId.setAttribute("data-menustate", "responsive");
    ContainMenuId.classList.remove("header__defaultmenu--wrapper");
    ContainMenuId.classList.add("header__responsivemenu--wrapper");


      MenuButton[i].setAttribute("data-button", "responsivemenuitem");
      MenuButton[i].classList.remove("header__defaultmenu--item");
      MenuButton[i].classList.add("header__responsivemenu--item");


for default, the title is on the bottom and the menu the miflr but vertivslly in ytht mifflr

for default. clicking the first time makes the normal link on the menubuttonns. the animation has been showing up the secon+ time, 
as I click to exit the deafult meu


4/24

containmenuis getting exit at start of animation and enter at the end
the hamburger is showing show...or not and thats why its working fine
menuclassexit isnt making anything dissappear

I think im overlapping the burger event vs the menu event

defaultscroll should be defaultbutton and be about linking ot another page     
        its the burger that handles the animation of the menu

I can use the responsivescroll event to link to other pages. THAT responsive one is better for different sections of the same page.
THIS one needs to be better for linking to other pages. dont need to use default or responsive diferences. 

4/25

/menu.html for relative links
#menu for certain section of page

was wrong. that doesnt work for any but one?

issue might be that containmenu isnt properly runningalso the array is in two places. can get rid of the responsive one
start line 27
Responsivescroll line 178

4/26

The links work now. I needed to change the html in order to do so. The other pages didnt have proper formatting


formatting needed according to prevoius version

<header>
        <nav></nav>
        <h1></h1>
</header>



fixed. NOw what I need to do is work on the burger. the styles of .header_default--wrapper dont seem to apple to it.
an important part is the grid so the styles are applied side to side instead of vertically

.header__default--wrapper was missing an underscore

fixed display from flex to grid. but now menu wont show up responsive.

control+mousedown allowing me to change the formatting of the inspecteleemtn
the issue has somethign to do with it being responsive. 
        There MIGHT be an issue with the divs being misplaced. in the original, I saw nav, header closers
        new verion, div, nav, header

        title needs to be removed when responsive 
'
fixed. was missing a div.

Need to do another round to check if everythings good



fix catering pricee

added <main> and <addres>


Need to work on the catering text
The hamburger animation is off


difference of headers in both versions

original

        navbar

4/27

nvm. it already is in it.
maybe i need to mvove a title

also issues with the fofrmatting of the elements

when at first miolbe: the burger is horizontal and the animation is fine, but nothing appears
        when brought to responsive and back to mobile, its vertical, and the menubuttons are off to the side
        it sort of works when responsive is first

maybe this issue is that containmenu isnt showing up.

data-menustate="responsive" vs default seems to be related
        responsive is causing nothign to happen. default is causing something, albiet flawed


inconsistencies >480px vs >781px, 

fixed those. the first click, the menu appears without animation
        second causes an animation to appear
        third. nothing happens

the first click causes menuclassexit, not enter

the burger event is doing 1,3 1,2 etc.
fixed the enter with a return

Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "setAttribute", MenuButton[i] is undefined line 92.

still not sure how the exit animation should be

didnt have exitanimation style. still need to fix, but there good progress

4/28


it turns out the animation duration was 0sec...
Need to figure out one last bit of animation. 
        the first click works well.
        the second does test2 but nothing happens
        the third does the expected slideout
        after that its 2,3,2,3,2,3 and everythings fine
        I suspect the problem is a specific line
