2/11

I need to reorganize the arhcitecture of the styles for article (and give a real name)

I did learn about cover for background iamge

have seperate container for the background image

Try to modify the font weights. the eights for the buttons are too much.



2/12

relative: where "should" be then moved
asbolute: compared to parent

need to fix the headers. its being fixed

seperate the header itseelf from the animating of the transition

2/13

shrink font size of title

the bottom went too to the bottom. need to make responsive, but correctly

issue: with the bottom section, because of the margin bottom, 
it technically doesnt have a height. that is why the button is in a strange position. 

button was part of wrong parent

mixin isnt working

2/14

mixin works now, not sure what mistake was

used height to make sure all of the sections have a good height

work on the specific mixin more. figure out the children. chatgpt/previouswork

2/15

still work on opacity

moved the buttons outside the background...not a good idea fo rhte opening?


the children inheret the styles of the parent

Need to add the footer. also add boxes for the secitons of text

2/16

align vertical justify horizontal. longer so hori
