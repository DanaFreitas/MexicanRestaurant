I need to reorganize the arhcitecture of the styles for article (and give a real name)

I did learn about cover for background iamge

have seperate container for the background image

Try to modify the font weights. the eights for the buttons are too much.



2/12

relative: where "should" be then moved
asbolute: compared to parent

need to fix the headers. its being fixed

seperate the header itseelf from the animating of the transition

2/13

shrink font size of title

the bottom went too to the bottom. need to make responsive, but correctly

issue: with the bottom section, because of the margin bottom, 
it technically doesnt have a height. that is why the button is in a strange position. 

button was part of wrong parent

mixin isnt working

2/14

mixin works now, not sure what mistake was

used height to make sure all of the sections have a good height

work on the specific mixin more. figure out the children. chatgpt/previouswork

2/15

still work on opacity

moved the buttons outside the background...not a good idea fo rhte opening?


the children inheret the styles of the parent

Need to add the footer. also add boxes for the secitons of text

2/16

align vertical justify horizontal. longer so hori

used letter spacing for the ?s

perfect bem.

should I move up the buttons and seperate the sections better?

2/17

still need to figure out that centering
        maybe a grandparent

need to reorganize the css.
        have more stuff be in the "homesection" css
                contactus and whoweare

2/18

display:
inline horizontal limited
inlin-block horizontal but can stretch

2/19

menu.scss AND typography scss were both involgin  the same text! eed to clean that up and organize better,

section tag was a problem

2/20

ctrl-shift-e
get to the side stuff

did shading for images

for the texts, make sure to properly set the displays for the wrappers

did it. itle needed a z-index of 2 to work. idk why

ctrl d highlight copies of the code

used word break and width to make shorter

why is the first section of menu centered but not the others?

make the directions look better


2/21
