2/11

I need to reorganize the arhcitecture of the styles for article (and give a real name)

I did learn about cover for background iamge

have seperate container for the background image

Try to modify the font weights. the eights for the buttons are too much.



2/12

relative: where "should" be then moved
asbolute: compared to parent

need to fix the headers. its being fixed

seperate the header itseelf from the animating of the transition

2/13

shrink font size of title

the bottom went too to the bottom. need to make responsive, but correctly

issue: with the bottom section, because of the margin bottom, 
it technically doesnt have a height. that is why the button is in a strange position. 

button was part of wrong parent

mixin isnt working

2/14

mixin works now, not sure what mistake was

used height to make sure all of the sections have a good height

work on the specific mixin more. figure out the children. chatgpt/previouswork

2/15

still work on opacity

moved the buttons outside the background...not a good idea fo rhte opening?


the children inheret the styles of the parent

Need to add the footer. also add boxes for the secitons of text

2/16

align vertical justify horizontal. longer so hori

used letter spacing for the ?s

perfect bem.

should I move up the buttons and seperate the sections better?

2/17

still need to figure out that centering
        maybe a grandparent

need to reorganize the css.
        have more stuff be in the "homesection" css
                contactus and whoweare

2/18

display:
inline horizontal limited
inlin-block horizontal but can stretch
block vertical

2/19

menu.scss AND typography scss were both involgin  the same text! eed to clean that up and organize better,

section tag was a problem

fill textts

2/20

ctrl-shift-e
get to the side stuff

did shading for images

for the texts, make sure to properly set the displays for the wrappers

did it. itle needed a z-index of 2 to work. idk why

ctrl d highlight copies of the code

used word break and width to make shorter

why is the first section of menu centered but not the others?

make the directions look better


2/21

the css for careers isnt working
nvm, misspelling

name in forms is used for browser requests

work on form
        should I use a placeholder?

include form to accept resume
include menu to accept jobs
include way to show what phone number to put include
        what to do about hyphens
remember FORM OVER FUNCTION

name of section on hop of input FOR NOW in mobile
        change for pc

look up clickable dropdown menu


there was an old liveform
        didnt update the form   
                did the trio
        now works

homepage

removed h1
        refreshed browser.
                nothing
        deleted and made new tab. worked.

went to careers
        old error still there 
                works now
        added new line
                doesnt work
accidentally tried again while on css
        went back to old page ctrl c
                didnt work
        right page now  ctrl c
                didnt work
undoing all bits
        command,watch,live
                didnt work
        watch,command,live
                didnt work

maybe the problem is that im using both the command line AND the extension

didnt work with just extension. maybe i need to wipe all of the liveservers first
        no. will try canceling the port too

...thats because the other one was being selected by default.

still...it might be worth to inquire if running both lives at once could be a problem

2/22

 <option value="none" selected disabled hidden>Select an Option</option>   

for forms, each part needs the same name

need better formatting
        the labels and inputs are much farther apart than the radio buttons and their labels      
                but i cant put those too far apart
        try having the section descriptions have the inputs
                can align everything to the left

come up with a backup font for rye        

rework the form buttons

2/23

fangsong

for font family "serif" or "san-serif" or generic stuff is a generic default


pages with buttons
        main
        NOT menu       
        NOT catering
        NOT directions
        careers
        contact
BUT.......the menu is on ALL pages

divide areas with sections or divs?



need to fix the buttons on the bottom...sooo close to finishing this part

replaced divs with sections

need to reorganize the forms
have the texts above the fields
        side by side doesnt work well on mobile

Had changed text colors from black to white because of dark backgrounds. need to find a good hover color. 
        remember: for testing, hover isnt a thing on mobile

to have the text in the right postion on the homepage, I need to use absolute display on the p tag.
        however...I need to find the right background for them, and/or darken the background images and make the text white.
                maybe have two different tests and compare side by side?

2/24 git reset is a thing

moved the labels up for the forms.

best practice find way to declare and set href locations using arrays

2/25

window.location vs location.href


need let thehref=pagename[i].getAttribute("href");
is it best practice to have the list of links in arrays together

does using notes.txt mess with the livesass
